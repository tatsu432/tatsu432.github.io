Hi there! My name is Tatsuhiro Shimizu. I am a senior at Waseda University, working towards a Bachelor of Arts in Economics at the School of Political Science and Economics.

My research area lies in Causal Inference, Machine Learning. I am interested in an algorithm to make a better decision based on data by inferring the causal relationship between variables.
